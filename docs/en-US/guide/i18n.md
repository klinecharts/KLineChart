# 🌏 Internationalization

Currently, the chart has two built-in `en-US` and `zh-CN`. The default language is `en-US`. If you need to use other languages, you can refer to the following scheme.

## Adding new language
Adding new language is accomplished through `klinecharts.registerLocale(key, locales)`.

For example, to add traditional Chinese language, you can do this,

```typescript
klinecharts.registerLocale('zh-HK', {
  time: '時間：',
  open: '開：',
  high: '高：',
  low: '低：',
  close: '收：',
  volume: '成交量：',
  turnover: '成交額：',
  change: '漲幅：'
})
```

## Use new language
After adding new language, you can complete language switching through the chart API `init(options)` or `setLocale(key)`.
